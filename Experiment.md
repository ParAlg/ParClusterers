## Data

The data file names used in the experiment can be obtained from 
```python
python3 data/files.py 
```
Then, each file can be downloaded from "https://storage.googleapis.com/pcbs_vldb_2025/[file_name]". For example, the labels for iris dataset can be downloaded from "https://storage.googleapis.com/pcbs_vldb_2025/UCIknnGraphs/iris.cmty.txt".
